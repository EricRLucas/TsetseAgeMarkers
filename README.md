Repository for analysis for tsetse age grading markers

Analysis can be repeated by running scripts in numerical order 01-05. The scripts were originally run in R version 3.4.4.

The .csv outputs of the scripts have been preserved in the repository. The .Rdata outputs have been omitted because of file size, 
and the .svg and .pdf outputs have been omitted for clarity (keeping the number of files small). The omitted files can be recreated 
by running the scripts.
